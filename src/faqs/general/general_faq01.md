### What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin is a store of value. Bitcoin is an exit.

It's money for the digital age, controlled by no one, available to anyone. It's an exit from the incumbent monetary system
which is broken, inflated and designed in a way to not properly store value over the longterm, so as to encourage spending.

Bitcoin is as a trust-minimized, permissionless, censorship resistant, peer to peer digital monetary protocol running on the internet.
It allows for the permissionless transfer of value between parties. It's permissionless because anyone can participate without asking permission or 
requiring the need of a trusted third party.

It's trust-minimized because there is no central authority in charge of making policy changes and protocol decisions. Although some trust is always required 
(trust in the open source code, the applications (Wallet software) used to communicate with the protocol) the intention is to reduce the amount of trust 
required and remove as much counterparty risk as possible.

It's censorship resistant because the network is decentralized (no central authority). Transactions are included in blocks by miners using Proof of Work. These miners
are located throughout the world, reducing the ability of central actors to influence which transactions should be included or not. The miners are kept in check by thousands of individual
node runners. These node operators check and validate that every transaction being included into the blockchain follow the

Anyone can run a node or use electricity to secure the network via mining (see **How does bitcoin mining work** below for more info).
