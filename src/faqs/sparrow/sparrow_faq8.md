## Troubleshooting

<h2 class="text-2xl pb-4 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">I recovered my wallet but there are no transactions</h2>

There are some common reasons as to why this could happen.

<br>

**1\.** **You entered the wrong words.** Any combination of 12 words will create a valid wallet. This is why you must make sure that you entered
your seed words exactly as they appeared when first creating it. *The same words, in the same order*.

<br>

**2\.** **You entered the wrong passphrase**. You entered the correct 12 words but the wrong passphrase, this too will generate a valid wallet, however
it wont be the same you originally created. Make sure you enter the correct passphrase (if you used one when creating the wallet).
