### [What is Bitcoin?](#what-is-bitcoin)

Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin is a store of value. Bitcoin is an exit.

<br>

It's money for the digital age â€” controlled by no one, accessible to everyone. 
It's an exit to the current monetary system, which is flawed, inflationary, and not designed to preserve long-term value, 
thus promoting spending over saving.

<br>

Bitcoin is a trust-minimized, permissionless, censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer digital monetary protocol running on the internet. 
It allows for the permissionless transfer of value between parties. Anyone can participate without asking permission or needing a trusted third party.

<br>

It's trust-minimized because there is no central authority in charge of making policy changes and protocol decisions. 
Although some trust is always required (trust in the open-source code, the applications (wallet software) used to communicate with the protocol), 
the intention is to reduce the amount of trust required and minimize counterparty risk as much as possible.

<br>

It's censorship-resistant because the network is decentralized (no central authority). 
Transactions are included in blocks by miners using Proof of Work. These miners are located throughout the world, 
reducing the ability of central actors to influence which transactions should be included or not. 
The miners are kept in check by thousands of individual node operators. These node operators check and validate that every transaction being included in 
the blockchain follow the <a class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-[#3c6594]" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Consensus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin consensus rules</a>.
Anyone can run a node or use electricity to secure the network via mining (see **How does bitcoin mining work** below for more info).
