### [How does Bitcoin mining work?](#how-does-bitcoin-mining-work)

Bitcoin mining involves individuals or groups using specialized mining computers (ASICs) and electricity to secure the bitcoin network. 
These "miners" compete by solving a mathematical problem known as Proof of Work, designed to be solved approximately every 10 minutes. 
When a miner successfully finds a solution that meets a specific pattern, they can add a new block to the bitcoin blockchain. 
Miners are rewarded with transaction fees from included transactions and a coinbase transaction that provides the current

The protocol aims for an average block discovery time of 10 minutes, though this can vary. Every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks), 
the protocol adjusts the difficulty of the mathematical problem to accommodate changes in network hashrate caused by new miners 
joining or leaving the network or existing miners upgrading their equipment. This process, known as the difficulty adjustment, is crucial for maintaining the 
integrity and stability of the bitcoin network.
