[Getting Ready](#coldcard-getting-ready)

<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Getting Ready</p>

First things first, get yourself a **Coldcard** directly from Coinkite's website above. The basic bundle comes with a **Coldcard MK4**, **2 industrial SD cards**,
and costs around $220, a small price to pay to protect generational wealth. 

<br>

At the same time, pick up a **Seedplate** and a **Center Punch**, you'll need those to backup
your seed words. Also, if you dont have any, grab <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto" href="https://www.amazon.com/GSE-Games-Sports-Expert-Serialized/dp/B07DF7C279/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1">a set of casino dice</a>, 
we'll use those to generate our own entropy when generating our a seed words. 

<br>

Never plug your Coldcard into a computer, you'll do everything offline (air-gapped), therefore we need a way to connect our Coldcard to power. Either plug it
into a USB battery pack/USB wall charger or get yourself some <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto" href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/cldpwr">Coldpower from coinkite</a>.
Lastly, if your computer does not have a MicroSD port, you can pick up a **MicroSD to USB adapter** from 
<a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto" href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MobileMate-microSD-Card-Reader/dp/B06G5JV2B5/ref=sr_1_2?sr=8-2">Amazon</a>.

Once you've received everything you can get started with setting up the Coldcard.
