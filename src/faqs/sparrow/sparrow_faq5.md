## Receiving your first transaction 

<h2 class="text-2xl pb-4 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">Receiving Your First Transaction</h2>

As with any other bitcoin wallet, receiving a transaction is quite simple.

<br>

**1\.** After creating your wallet, click on the **Receive** tab located on the left side panel.

</a>

<br>

**2\.** You'll find a receive address in the first field, you can copy that address and use it to receive bitcoin. You may also add a **Label**, 
        this will help you identify the origin of these funds and is only visible to you. Once received, the transaction will appear in the **Transaction tab**.

</a>

<br>

**3\.** The wallet software automatically detects if that specific address receives bitcoin and when it does, it updates to a new receive address. ***Never reuse addresses***. 
        If you're unsure you can click **Get New Address** in the bottom right corner.
