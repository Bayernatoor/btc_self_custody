### Quick wallet setup guide
Let's get you up and running with your own self-custody bitcoin wallet!

&nbsp;

**1\.** After installing and opening the app, select **New Wallet**. 

**2\.** Feel free to complete the profile or just skip this part for now. If you've already got a Nostr profile you can import it below using your Nostr private key.

**3\.** You may pick a Federation or skip, if you don't know what this is, I recommend tapping **Skip for now**.

**5\.** Congrats! You've created your first Bitcoin wallet. However, you still need to backup your private key!

**6\.** Click on **Secure your Funds!** then on **TAP TO REVEAL SEED WORDS**.

**7\.** Write down these 12 words in the correct order. Keep them safe and never store them online or give them to someone else. 
        **If you lose these words you cannot recover your bitcoin. You've been warned!**

**8\.** Once copied, review each word to ensure you copied them correctly, remember you're now taking self-custody of your funds.
        If you lose your phone, you'll need these 12 words to restore access to your bitcoin. 

**9\.** Follow the prompts to complete the process.

&nbsp;

That's all, you've successfully created your first bitcoin wallet and backed up your 12 seed words which represent your bitcoin private key.
