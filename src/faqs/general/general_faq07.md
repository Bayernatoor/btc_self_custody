### How does bitcoin mining work?  

Bitcoin mining consists of a person or group of people who use specialized mining computers & electricity to secure 
the bitcoin network. These "miners" compete against one another by expending electricity to find a solution to a mathematical problem, also
known as the Proof of Work. The mathematical problem is meant to be solved on average every 10 minutes. When a miner finds a solution that matches
a predetermined pattern, they may add the block to the bitcoin blockchain. Miners who find solutions are rewarded with the fees included in the
transactions, as well as a coinbase transaction which rewards them with the current <a class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-[#3c6594]" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply" target="_blank"

The protocol stipulates that on average 1 block should be found every 10 minutes. It's important to remember
that this will fluctuate but that over the course of 2016 blocks the average block time should be ~10 minutes. In order to 
account for additional miners joining the network and increasing the hashrate, the difficulty of the problem is adjusted
every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks). This is called *the difficulty adjustment* and is vital to the proper functioning of the protocol.
