## Wallet recovery 

<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Recovering your Wallet</p>

Wallet recovery can be done using any software that supports BIP39 mnemonic seeds. If you followed this guide, including Sparrow's quick start guide, then you've 
got a BIP39 mnemonic seed. Recovering using Sparrow wallet is very similar to wallet creation.

<br>

**1\.** From the top menu click on **File** then click on **New Wallet**. Enter a name for your wallet.

<br>

**2\.** You'll be taken to the **Settings** tab to setup a new wallet. Leave everything as is and click on **New or Imported Software Wallet**.

<br>

**3\.** A new window will appear, you'll select the first option **Mnemonic Words**, click on the down arrow and select **Use 12 words**.

<br>

**4\.** Enter the 12 words you copied when originally setting up your wallet. They must be in the correct order. 
        Enter a **passphrase** if you used one when originally creating this wallet. 

<br>

**5\.** If you followed this guide you would have stored the **passphrase** apart from your 12 words. 
        If the seed is valid, **Valid Checksum** will turn green. Click on **Create Keystore** and then click on **Import Keystore**.

<br>

**6\.** Finally, click on **Apply** in the bottom right corner. If you correctly entered your seed words, your transactions will start appearing below the **Transactions** tab.
