### Getting Ready

First things first, get yourself a Coldcard directly from Coinkite's website above.
The basic bundle comes with a Coldcard MK4, 2 industrial SD cards, and costs around $220—a small price to pay to protect generational wealth.

At the same time, pick up a Seedplate and a Center Punch; you'll need those to back up your seed words. 
Also, if you don’t have any, grab <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://www.amazon.com/GSE-Games-Sports-Expert-Serialized/dp/B07DF7C279/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1">a set of casino dice</a>; 
we'll use those to generate our own entropy when generating our seed words.

<br>

Never plug your Coldcard into a computer. You'll do everything offline (air-gapped); 
therefore, we need a way to connect our Coldcard to power. Either plug it into a USB battery pack/USB wall charger or 
get yourself some <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://store.coinkite.com/store/cldpwr">Coldpower from Coinkite</a>. 
Lastly, if your computer does not have a MicroSD port, you can pick up a MicroSD to USB adapter from <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MobileMate-microSD-Card-Reader/dp/B06G5JV2B5/ref=sr_1_2?sr=8-2">Amazon</a>.

Once you've received everything, you can get started with setting up the Coldcard.
