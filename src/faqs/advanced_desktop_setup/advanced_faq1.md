<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Getting Up To Speed</p>

**Note for all users: Since we're now in the advanced stage of self-custody, if at all possible, I recommend using a dedicated computer. Some computer whose only
job is to run bitcoin software. So, although you may already have Sparrow Wallet installed on your main computer you might want to consider updating your setup before proceeding.**


<br>

If you've followed the basic and intermediate guides so far, and you're happy with your setup, go ahead and skip the items below.
Otherwise, if you're new here and have yet to take self-custody of your bitcoin and intend to follow this advanced guide then we'll need to get a few things setup before.

<br>

**1\.** Follow the <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="/guides/basic/desktop/sparrow">Basic guide<a> to setup Sparrow Wallet. Download the latest
version of Sparrow Wallet and follow the first 2 items "Quick word.." and "Verifying the downloaded binary..".

<br>

**2\.** Next, follow part 2 of the **<a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="/guides/intermediate/node">Intermediate guide<a>** to select and setup a node implementation. 

<br>

**Note: A personal bitcoin node is NOT mandatory but proceeding without your personal node will reduce your privacy, therefore it is highly recommended.**

<br>

Once you've completed these 2 tasks come back to this page.
