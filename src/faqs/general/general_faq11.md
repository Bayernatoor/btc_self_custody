### What's a bitcoin wallet? 

A bitcoin wallet is software that you download and install on your device. The wallet stores
your bitcoin private key. It does not itself store any actual bitcoin. Another term for bitcoin wallet is 
bitcoin signing device. This term is more appropriate since a bitcoin wallet simply stores your keys and allows you
to create transactions and sign them using your private key. As long as you keep your bitcoin private key safe and secure you can access your funds using any modern bitcoin wallet software.
