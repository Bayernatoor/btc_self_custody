[Connecting to Sparrow Wallet](#connecting-to-sparrow-wallet)

You've setup your Coldcard and backed up your seed words. Now's the time to get it connected to Sparrow wallet so that 
we can easily receive and transfer bitcoin, all without our seed words touching the internet.

This guide assumes that you've already installed the Sparrow Desktop Wallet. If not, you can find a **<a href="/guides/basic/desktop">quick guide here</a>**. Once installed come 
back to this guide, no need to create a wallet.

To eliminate the need for you to trust me and since Sparrow's documentation is so good I will refer you to their guide for this step. This guide also covers, receiving and sending
bitcoin using your Coldcard and Sparrow Wallet.
