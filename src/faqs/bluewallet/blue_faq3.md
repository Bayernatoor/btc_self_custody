## How do I receive bitcoin?

Receiving Bitcoin is very easy. 

&nbsp;

**1\.** From the main page tap on your newly created wallet. 

**2\.** On the bottom of the screen tap on **Receive**.

**3\.** Confirm that you have written down the 12 words, tap on **Yes, I have**. *Make sure you wrote them down!*

**4\.** You'll be presented with a QR code and a public bitcoin address (starts with bc1). The sender can scan the QR code to send bitcoin directly to this address or you can copy the address and share it. 

**5\.** You can also tap **Share** at the bottom of the screen to share the address using an App.

&nbsp;

Once the bitcoin is sent it must be included in a block (confirmed/mined). The transaction will appear as *Pending* below **Transactions**. You'll notice it says **0 conf**. It takes a mininum of 1 confirmation before
you can consider the bitcoin yours. It is typically recommended to wait for 6 confirmations before the transaction is considered settled. - 1 confirmation typically takes 10 minutes (on average).
