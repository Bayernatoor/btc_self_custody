## Receiving my first transaction 

As with any other bitcoin wallet, receiving a transaction is quite simple.

&nbsp;

**1\.** After creating your wallet, click on the **Receive** tab located on the left side panel.

&thinsp;

**2\.** You'll find a receive address in the first field, you can copy that address and use it to receive bitcoin. Once received, the transaction will appear in the 
**Transaction tab**. 

&thinsp;

**3\.** The wallet software automitically detects if that specific address receives bitcoin when it does it updates to a new receive address. ***Never reuse addresses***. If your not sure
you can click **Get New Address** in the bottom right corner.
