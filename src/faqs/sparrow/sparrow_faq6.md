Sending bitcoin from your Sparrow wallet is easy and a great way to learn the inner workings of a bitcoin transaction.
Sparrow walks you through the process and visually demonstrates each step. 

<br>

**1\.** Click on the **Send** tab on the left side panel.

<br>

**2\.** In the **Pay to** field, enter the destination address. This is a bitcoin address given to you by the receivee or it could be your own 
if you wish to do a self transfer.

<br>

**3\.** In the **Label** field, enter an optional and locally stored reason for the send.

<br>

**4\.** Enter the **Amount** in BTC or in sats, you can change denomination via the dropdown arrow.

<br>

**5\.** Sparrow automatically calculates a medium-priority fee rate for you. This may, 
in some circumstances, be too high or low. I always recommend visiting <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mempool.space<a>
to get a better idea of current fees. If this transaction is very important and needs to be sent quickly, 
you may want to change to a higher fee. Conversely, if you have time and don’t mind waiting, 
you can go ahead and slide the fee to a lower amount. Be careful not to set the fee too low, as your transaction could take weeks or might never get confirmed.


<br>

**6\.** Once you've confirmed that all the information is correct (**triple check the sending address**), click on **Create Transaction**.

</a>

<br>

**9\.** After broadcasting the transacton, click on **Transactions** in the top left corner to view its status.

Congrats, you’ve just sent your first Bitcoin transaction from your very own self-custodial wallet. 
The transaction has been broadcast to the network and must now be included in a block (confirmed/mined). 
After one confirmation, the Bitcoin is confirmed and is now owned by the recipient. 
It is typically recommended to wait for six confirmations before the transaction is considered entirely settled. 
One confirmation typically takes about 10 minutes on average.
