## HELP, I recovered my wallet but there are no transactions

There are some common reasons as to why this could happen.

&thinsp;

**1\.** **You entered the wrong words.** Any combination of 12 words will create a valid wallet. This is why you must make sure that you entered
your seed exactly as it appeared when first creating it. *The same words, in the same order*.

&thinsp;

**2\.** **You entered the wrong passphrase**. You entered the correct 12 words but the wrong passphrase, this too will generate a valid wallet, however
it wont be the same you originally created. Make sure you enter the correct passphrase (if you originally used one).
