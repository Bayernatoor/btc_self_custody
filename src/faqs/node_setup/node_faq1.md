### [Why run a Bitcoin Node?](#intermediate-why-run-a-bitcoin-node)

<h4 class="text-2xl pb-4 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">Running Bitcoin</h4>

A Bitcoin node is a computer (server) that runs Bitcoin software such as 
<a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin Core</a>. 
Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin network, downloads, and fully validates blocks and transactions.

<br>

Running your own copy of the Bitcoin Core code allows you to personally validate 
every block and broadcast your own transactions, all without depending on a trusted third party. 
It provides you with additional privacy and security while also helping to decentralize the peer-to-peer network. 
Running Bitcoin is our way to help keep the network honest, ensure consensus rules are being followed, and become sovereign Bitcoin users. If not you, then who?
