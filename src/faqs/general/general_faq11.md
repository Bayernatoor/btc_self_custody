### What's a bitcoin wallet?

A **bitcoin wallet** is software that you download and install on your device. 
The wallet securely stores your bitcoin private key, which is essential for accessing and managing your bitcoin. 
Contrary to common misconception, a bitcoin wallet does not store actual bitcoins but rather the keys that enable transactions.

Another term for a bitcoin wallet is a **bitcoin signing device**. This term more accurately reflects its function: 
storing your keys and facilitating the creation and signing of transactions using your private key. As long as you safeguard your bitcoin private key, 
you can access your funds using any modern bitcoin wallet software.
