## Getting Ready 

First things first, get yourself a Coldcard directly from Coinkite's website above. The basic bundle comes with a Coldcard MK4, 2 industrial SD cards,
and costs around $220, a small price to pay to protect generational wealth. 

&nbsp;

At the same time, pick up a Seedplate and a Center Punch, you'll need those to backup
your seed words. Also, if you dont have any, grab **[a set of casino dice](https://www.amazon.com/GSE-Games-Sports-Expert-Serialized/dp/B07DF7C279/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1)**, we'll use those to generate our own entropy when creating a seed. 

&nbsp;

Never plug your Coldcard into a computer, you'll do everything air-gapped, therefore we need a way to connect our Coldcard to power. Either you plug it
into a USB battery pack/USB wall charger or get yourself some **[Coldpower from coinkite](https://store.coinkite.com/store/cldpwr)**. Lastly, if your computer
does not have a microSD port, you can pick up a microSD to USB adapter from **[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MobileMate-microSD-Card-Reader/dp/B06G5JV2B5/ref=sr_1_2?sr=8-2)**.

&nbsp;

Once you've received everything you can get started with setting up the Coldcard.
