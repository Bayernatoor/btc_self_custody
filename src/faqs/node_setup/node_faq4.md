## MyNode Setup

Sparrow wallet (only available on desktop) is by far the best open-source bitcoin only desktop wallet. 
It's been built from the ground up to be as robust and feature rich as possible without overwhelming the user while at the 
same time educating the user on the inner workings of bitcoin. I highly recommend that you take the time to carefully
read their documentation and guides (presented below). You'll be up and running before you know it!
