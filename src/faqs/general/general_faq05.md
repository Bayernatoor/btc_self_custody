### What is a bitcoin transaction?

Simply put, a bitcoin transaction represents the transfer of value between 1 or more participants of the bitcoin network.

&nbsp;

A bitcoin transaction consists of 1 or more inputs and 1 or more outputs. Ultimately, all inputs/ouputs are
called *unspent transaction ouputs* or UTXO for short. The collection of all UTXOs is called the UXTO set, which 
can be calculated & verified by anyone running a bitcoin node. This UTXO set is equal to all "bitcoins" in circulation.  

&nbsp;

The UTXO set is constantly growing and shrinking depending on the transactions being broadcasted to the network. 
UTXOs themselves are indivisible so in order to divide them, new UTXOs must be created. 
You can consolidate multiple UTXOs into a single one or you can divide 1 UTXO into multiples. All of this 
is done via bitcoin transactions.
