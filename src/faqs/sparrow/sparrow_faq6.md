## Sending my first transaction 

Sending bitcoin from your Sparow wallet is easy and a great way to learn the inner workings of a bitcoin transaction.
Sparrow walks you through the process and visually demonstrates each step. 

&nbsp;

**1\.** Click on the **Send** tab on the left side panel.

&thinsp;

**2\.** In the **Pay to** field, enter the destination address. This is a bitcoin address given to you by the receivee or it could be your own 
if you wish to do a self transfer.

&thinsp;

**3\.** In the **Label** field, enter an optional and locally stored reason for the send.

&thinsp;

**4\.** Enter the **Amount** in BTC or in sats, you can change denomination via the dropdown arrow.

&thinsp;

**5\.** Sparrow automatically calculates a medium priority fee rate for you. This may in some circumstances be too high.
I always recommend visiting [**mempool.space**](https://mempool.space/) to get a better idea of current fees. If this transaction
is very important and needs to be sent quickly you may want to change to a higher fee, or if you've got time and don't mind waiting then
go ahead and slide the fee to a lower amount. Be careful not to set a fee that is too low as your transaction could take weeks or could 
never end up getting confirmed.
