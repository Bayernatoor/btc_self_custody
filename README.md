## About

This website is built using using [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) a Rust web framework library. It's a personal project meant to help me learn web development, Rust, Postgres etc... and to help refine my understanding of 
btc self-custody. It's a way for me to do my small part for Bitcoin education.
