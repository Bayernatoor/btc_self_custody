### What's a bitcoin mempool?

A <ins><a href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitcoin mempool</a></ins> contains a temporary record of all unconfirmed transactions. 
Every node on the network maintains it's own mempool.

You can visualize a mempool as follows. Imagine going to the dentist, you'll check-in at reception then wait in the waiting room. However,
this dentist is somewhat of a capitalist and will see patients based on the fee that they are willing to pay. The higher the fee, the quicker
you get to see the dentist. The lower the fee the longer you wait. Although simplified, the mempool works in a similar fashion. As transactions
get broadcasted they sit unconfirmed in the mempool waiting for a bitcoin miner to include them in their block template. Miners are incentivized to include
transactions based on their fee rate, the higher the fee, the sooner your transaction gets confirmed.
