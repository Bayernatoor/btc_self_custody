## How do I send bitcoin?

<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Sending Bitcoin is Easy</p>

**1\.** From the main page tap on your newly created wallet. 

<br>

**2\.** On the bottom of the screen tap on **Send**.

<br>

**3\.** Enter the amount you wish to send. Tap the arrows to the right to change the currency (bitcoin, Sats or fiat).

<br>

**4\.** In the **Address** field enter the address of the receiver. 

<br>

**5\.** In the **Note to self** field enter a reference for the payment - only you can see this. 

<br>

**6\.** Tap on **Fee** to set an appropriate fee*.

<br>

**7\.** Tap on **Next**, you'll be taken to a confirmation page. Review the amount and the address, you may tap **Details** in the top right corner for more information. 

<br>

**8\.** Tap **Send Now** to broadcast the transaction. 

<br>

***Note:*** *A note on fees. Bitcoin blocks have limited space which inherently creates a fee market. Fees will go up as demand for block space increases. Although
             wallets do a decent job in suggesting a feerate based on how quickly you need the transaction confirmed, I 
             recommend checking <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank">Mempool Space<a> to determine
             an appropriate fee to set. If you're in no rush, setting it low can help you save some sats.*


<br>

That's it! The transaction has been broadcast to the network and must now be included in a block (confirmed/mined). 
The transaction will appear as ***Pending*** below ***Transactions***. You'll notice it says **0 conf**. After 1 confirmation the bitcoin is confirmed and
is now owned by the recipient. It is typically recommended to wait for 6 confirmations before the transaction is considered entirely settled. 
1 confirmation typically takes 10 minutes (on average).
