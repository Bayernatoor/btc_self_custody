<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Mutiny Wallet Explained</p>

Mutiny wallet is an On-chain, Lightning and Federation capable bitcoin wallet. 
Providing you with plenty of sending and receiving options. That being said it can be a bit overwhelming at first. 
Using Mutiny wallet for on-chain transactions is simple, effective and works well as a self-custodial mobile wallet used for small amounts.

<br>

Eventually, as your bitcoin holdings grow you'll want to upgrade your  self-custodial setup (see our other guides). However, Mutiny can 
continue to serve as your **spending** wallet. You may want to use the Lightning network and custodial solutions such as Federations. 
Make sure to learn the differences and trade-offs. More information on the protocol that powers Federations can be found

By tapping on the top left icon you can view and edit your profile. Mutiny displays your total
balance at the very top of the app, however, from the profile page you can view the individual balances of your 
on-chain, lightning and federation wallets.

<p class="text-lg pb-2 font-semibold">The Settings</p>

Tapping on the red **M** in the top right corner takes you to the settings page. From this page you can backup your seed words or restore a previous wallet
(**This will replace the existing one**). You can add a password to the wallet to prevent third parties from accessing your funds. Mutiny also gives you the option to run your own servers, and open your own channels.
On top of this you can change the appearance and add a Nostr key. At the very bottom you have access to debugging tools and an admin page.
