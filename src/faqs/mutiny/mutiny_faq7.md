### I lost my phone what do I do?

Since youâ€™ve lost your phone you should consider the wallet on that device comprised.
If you've lost your phone you should immediately follow the above **How do I restore my wallet**. 
Once restored, you'll want to create a new wallet and transfer the funds. 

Mutiny does not support multiple wallets, therefore, I recommend restoring your 12 words on a new install of Mutiny. 
Then following our Blue Wallet guide to setup a new wallet using Blue wallet and finally transfering your Mutiny balance over to it. 
Once that is done you can decide which wallet software to use with your new seed words.
