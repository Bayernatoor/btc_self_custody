<h4 class="text-2xl pb-4 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">Receiving Your First Transaction</h4>

Receiving Bitcoin is easy. That being said, Mutiny excels at being a Lightning wallet. Lighting allows for instantaneous and low fee payments.
This is why you'll see the word **Sats** everywhere, sats, short for satoshi is the smallest unit of a bitcoin, 1 bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis.
With all that said, we'll start with receiving an On-chain (Regular) payment with Mutiny. 

<br>

**1\.** From the main page tap on **Receive your first sats**.

<br>

**7\.** When the wallet detects that the payment has been sent, the page will update with a large green check mark and the words **Payment Initiated**.
        You can tap on **View Payment Details** for more information or tap on **Nice** to go back to the main page.

<br>

***Note:*** *Once the bitcoin is sent it must be included in a block (confirmed/mined). 
            The transaction will appear as ***Pending*** on the main page. You can get basic information by tapping on the transaction. 
            It takes a mininum of 1 confirmation before you can consider the bitcoin yours. 
            It is typically recommended to wait for 6 confirmations before the transaction is considered settled. 1 confirmation typically takes 10 minutes (on average).*
