## Basic recommended setup

Starting with a basic bitcoin desktop wallet setup is a good way to get comfortable with bitcoin while ensuring
a higher level of security compared to a mobile wallet. It also allows for room to iterate on your setup as your bitcoin
holdings grow in value.

&nbsp;

**Recommended Setup:**

We'll create a single signature wallet using 12 words and a passphrase. This setup is simple yet secure. It makes
recovery easy and avoids some pitfalls associated with more complex setups. Due to the passphrase (13th word) you
benefit from highten security, since, if someone was to get access to your 12 word seed, they would not
gain access to your funds. Which is why the 12 words and the passphrase should be stored separately. 

&nbsp;

**Quick Start Guide:**

Since the Sparrow documentation is some of the best out there and to eliminate any trust issues, I recommend following their amazing getting started guide here: <strong><ins><a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/quick-start.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick Start</a></ins></strong>

**However, before you begin note the following:**

&nbsp;

**1\.** Sparrow's quick start guide does not make use of the passphrase when creating a wallet. I recommend that you do. When copying your 12 words, you'll notice a checkbox called
**Use passphrase?**, check it and a field will appear. Add a passphrase (13th word). Make sure it's unique, write it down and keep it apart from your 12 words. 

&thinsp;

**2\.** Anytime you open this wallet you'll be asked to enter your wallet passphrase. This is not the same as a password! The password you setup on sparrow is only meant to prevent unauthorized access
to the Sparrow application and can be reset. 

&thinsp;

**3\.** Unless you've already got your own bitcoin blockchain node. Using a **Public Server** is a fine way to get started. Later guides will touch on setting up a bitcoin node. Which
will help increase your privacy.

&thinsp;

**4\.** Keeping your setup simple at first is best. Future guides will touch on more complex setups. 
    Normally, the more bitcoin you have to protect the more security you want. A good rule of thumb, protect your bitcoin as if it was worth 10x its current value.

*Remember store the 12 words and the passphrase separately but don't lose them, you need both to recover your bitcoin.*
