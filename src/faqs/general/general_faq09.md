### What are bitcoin private/public keys? 

Bitcoin private and public keys are essential cryptographic components in the Bitcoin network.

<br>

**Private Key:** This is a secret alphanumeric string or a series of 12/24 words known only to the owner .
It allows the owner to access and control their bitcoin. A private key is mathematically linked to a public key but should never be shared.

<br>

**Public Key:** Derived from the private key, the public key is used to generate a Bitcoin address. 
This address serves as a destination for receiving bitcoins. While the public key can be freely shared to receive funds, 
it cannot be used to reverse-engineer the private key.

In essence, the private key acts as a digital signature for transactions, ensuring security and authenticity, 
while the public key facilitates the verification of ownership and enables the receipt of bitcoins.
