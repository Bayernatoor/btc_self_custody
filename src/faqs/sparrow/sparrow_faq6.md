## Sending my first transaction 

<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Sending Bitcoin</p>

Sending bitcoin from your Sparrow wallet is easy and a great way to learn the inner workings of a bitcoin transaction.
Sparrow walks you through the process and visually demonstrates each step. 

<br>

**1\.** Click on the **Send** tab on the left side panel.

<br>

**2\.** In the **Pay to** field, enter the destination address. This is a bitcoin address given to you by the receivee or it could be your own 
if you wish to do a self transfer.

<br>

**3\.** In the **Label** field, enter an optional and locally stored reason for the send.

<br>

**4\.** Enter the **Amount** in BTC or in sats, you can change denomination via the dropdown arrow.

<br>

**5\.** Sparrow automatically calculates a medium priority fee rate for you. This may in some circumstances be too high.
I always recommend visiting <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank">Mempool.space<a>
to get a better idea of current fees. If this transaction
is very important and needs to be sent quickly you may want to change to a higher fee, or if you've got time and don't mind waiting then
go ahead and slide the fee to a lower amount. Be careful not to set a fee that is too low as your transaction could take weeks or could 
never end up getting confirmed. 

<br>

**6\.** Once you've confirmed that all the information is correct (**triple check the sending address**), click on **Create Transaction**.

<br>

**7\.** On the next page transaction details will be displayed  you may review them then click on the big blue button **Finalize Transaction for Signing**.

<br>

**8\.** Click on **Sign**. 

<br>

**9\.** The final step! To send the transaction click on **Broadcast Transaction**.

<br>

Congrats, you've just sent your first bitcoin transaction from your very own self-custodial wallet.
