### More information about Mutiny wallet.

Mutiny wallet is an on-chain, lightning and federation capable bitcoin wallet. 
Providing you with plenty of sending and receiving options. That being said it can be a bit overwhelming at first. 
Using Mutiny wallet for on-chain transactions is simple, effective and works well as a self-custodial mobile wallet used for small amounts.

Eventually, as your bitcoin holdings grow you'll want to upgrade your  self-custodial setup (see our other guides). However, Mutiny can 
continue to serve as your **spending** wallet. You may want to use the Lightning network and custodial solutions such as Federations. 
Make sure to learn the differences and trade-offs. More information on the protocol that powers Federations can be found **[here](https://fedimint.org/docs/intro)** 
as well as an intro the Lighting network **[here](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/lightning-network/)**
