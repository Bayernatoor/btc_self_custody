</a>

<br>

**5\.** That's it! You've received your first bitcoin transaction. It is typically recommended to wait for atleast 1 confirmation before considering the bitcoin yours. If 
        the amount is large I recommend waiting up to 6 confirmations (If you sold your car for bitcoin and are about to hand over the keys ;) ).
