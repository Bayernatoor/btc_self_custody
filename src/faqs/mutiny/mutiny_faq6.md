### How do I restore my wallet?

<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Restoring your Wallet</p>

As long as you propely backed up your 12 seed words, restoring a wallet is easy. You can use 
any BIP39 compatible wallet, however, we'll assume your using Mut:iny wallet.

<br>

**1\.** Assuming that you've reinstalled Mutiny app, open it and click on **Import Existing**.

<br>

**2\.** Enter the 12 words you originally wrote down in the correct order.

<br>

**3\.** Press **Restore** and then press **Confirm**. 

<br>

**Be patient**, Mutiny will attempt to recover your wallet.

<br>

**4\.** Congrats, you've successfully restored your wallet, your balance should appear at the very top.

<br>

**5\.** If your funds do not appear, tap on the red **M** in the top right corner, scroll all the way
down to **Admin Page**. From there go down to **Resync wallet**. Return to the main page and wait, 
your transactions should start to appear. 

<br>

***Note:*** *Restoring a wallet in this way will replace any existing Mutiny wallet currently on your phone.*
