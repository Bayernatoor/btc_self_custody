### I lost my phone what do I do?

If you've lost your phone you should immediately follow the above **How do I restore my wallet**. 
Once restored, you'll want to create a new wallet and transfer the funds. You should consider the previous
wallet compromised and never use it again. 

Mutiny does not support multiple wallets, therefore, I recommend restoring your 12 words on a new install of Mutiny. 
Then following our Blue Wallet guide to setup a new wallet using Blue wallet and finally transfering your Mutiny balance over to it. 
Once that is done you can decide which wallet software to use with your new seed words.
