You've setup your Coldcard and backed up your seed words, Passphrase and Extended Fingerprint. Now's the time to get it connected to Sparrow Wallet so that 
we can easily receive and transfer bitcoin, all without our seed words being exposed to the internet.

This guide assumes that you've already installed the Sparrow Desktop Wallet. If not, you can find a <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="/guides/basic/desktop">quick guide here</a>.
Once installed come back to this guide, no need to create a wallet within Sparrow.

<br>

To eliminate the need for you to trust me and since Sparrow's documentation is excellent, I will refer you to their guide for this step. This guide also covers, receiving and sending
bitcoin using your Coldcard and Sparrow Wallet. 

<br>

***Note***: *If you do not have a third MicroSD card, I recommend using the MicroSD card with your Passphrase to export the wallet connection file, since you'll have to enter your Passphrase anyway*.

<p class="text-xl pb-4 font-semibold">❗Warning❗</p>

***REMEMBER***, your coldcard is setup to use a passphrase, make sure you enter it manually or via the MicroSD card before ***exporting the wallet connection file or signing transactions!***
