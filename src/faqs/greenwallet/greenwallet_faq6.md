## I lost my phone what do I do? 

You'll want to locate the **12 words** and **passphrase** you wrote down when setting up your wallet. Either re-install Samourai and follow their restore guide [here]( https://docs.samourai.io/wallet/restore-recovery) or use any other BIP39 compatible wallet.  

I highly recommend that once the wallet is recovered that you transfer all funds to a new wallet. Although your Samourai backup is encrypted on your phone, it's best to er on the side of caution, you should consider the original wallet compromised.
