### Which node should I chose?

<h4 class="text-2xl pb-4 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">Choosing a Node Implementation</h4>

We’re breaking tradition here and offering more choices! Over the years, the ecosystem surrounding 
self-custodial Bitcoin node implementations has exploded. There are many to choose from, and to make it easier, 
I’ve gone ahead and selected three different options, each with its unique take on running Bitcoin.

Gone are the days of having to manage everything yourself. Whether you build your 
own node or purchase a pre-built model, these implementations take care of the nitty-gritty so that you don’t need to.

All of these implementations offer the option of purchasing a pre-made node (essentially a personal home server). 
They come pre-installed with everything you’ll need. They also provide the option to DIY your own node. 
However, this means that you’ll have to source all components, manually install software, and wait for everything to sync. 
This could take anywhere from a few hours to an entire weekend. That being said, building it yourself is a great learning experience and allows you to better understand how everything works.

If you do decide to build your own node, I would highly recommend that you avoid using single-board computers such as a Raspberry Pi. 
Although cheap and practical, these computers are often underpowered and potentially vulnerable to attack. 
You’ll often see these recommended, but you’ll also notice that most pre-made nodes are moving away from using these in favor of more powerful and secure hardware. 
For a bit more money, you can get yourself a used Lenovo laptop or a Dell OptiPlex, which naturally comes with more memory, storage, and a faster processor. 
That being said, if you're simply looking to get started, want to explore without spending too many sats, and run Bitcoin, then a Raspberry Pi can be a good way to start. Ultimately, it’s your node, so it’s your choice!

In this section, to reduce trust, I’ve chosen to simply provide you with details of each 
implementation and then point you to their resources. Who better to walk you through the process than the ones who created them!

Alright, let’s run through the different implementations so that you can make an informed choice.
