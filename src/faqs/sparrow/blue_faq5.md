**1\.** Re-install BlueWallet or any Bip39 compatible wallet 

**2\.** Locate the **12 or 24 words** you wrote down when first creating the wallet. 

**3\.** After re-installing and opening BlueWallet. Click on **Add a wallet**.

**4\.** Enter a name for your wallet in the first field. 

**5\.** Tap on **Import wallet** at the bottom of the screen.
