<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Receiving Bitcoin</p>

Receiving Bitcoin is easy. That being said, Mutiny excels at being a Lightning wallet. Lighting allows for instantaneous and low fee payments.
This is why you'll see the word **Sats** everywhere, sats, short for satoshi is the smallest unit of a bitcoin, 1 bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis.
With all that said, we'll start with receiving an On-chain (Regular) payment with Mutiny. 

<br>

**1\.** From the main page tap **Receive your first sats**. 

<br>

**2\.** Enter the amount you wish to receive. If you're not sure of the exact amount, that's fine just enter any amount in satoshi. 

<br>

**3\.** You may disregard the message regarding a minimum amount. (*Unless you intend to receive via lightning*)

<br>

**4\.** In the **What's this for?** field enter a label (optional) for these funds. This will help you keep track of where they came from.  

<br>

**5\.** Press **Continue**. On the next screen, at the very bottom, tap on **Choose format** and select the 3rd option **Bitcoin address**.

<br>

**6\.** You'll be presented with a QR code which can be scanned by the **Sender**, or you can copy the bitcoin address (starts with bc1) and share that with the **Sender**. 

<br>

**7\.** When the wallet detects that the payment has been sent, the page will update with a large green check mark and the words **Payment Initiated**.

<br>

***Note:*** *Once the bitcoin is sent it must be included in a block (confirmed/mined). 
            The transaction will appear as ***Pending*** on the main page. You can get basic information by tapping on the transaction. 
            It takes a mininum of 1 confirmation before you can consider the bitcoin yours. 
            It is typically recommended to wait for 6 confirmations before the transaction is considered settled. 1 confirmation typically takes 10 minutes (on average).*
