### I lost my phone what do I do?

<p class="text-lg pb-4 font-semibold">Lost Phone</p>

If you've lost your phone you should immediately follow the above **How do I restore my wallet**. 

<br>

<p class="text-lg pb-2 font-semibold">❗Warning❗</p>

**Since you’ve lost your phone you should consider the wallet on that device compromised.
Once restored, you'll want to create a new wallet and transfer the funds.**

Mutiny does not support multiple wallets, therefore, I recommend restoring your 12 words on a new install of Mutiny. 
Then following our BlueWallet guide to setup a new wallet using BlueWallet and finally transfering your Mutiny balance over to it. 
Once that is done you can decide which wallet software to use with your new seed words.
