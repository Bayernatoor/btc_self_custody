## How do I receive bitcoin?

From the main Deposit account page, tap on the blue circle with the + sign, located in the bottom right corner. Select **Receive**, the sender can **scan the QR code** or alternatively you can tap on the bitcoin address at top. Tap **YES** to copy the address to your clipboard.
