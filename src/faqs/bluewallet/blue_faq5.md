If you've lost your phone or accidentally deleted the BlueWallet app you can easily recover your bitcoin by following these steps. 

<br>

**1\.** Re-install BlueWallet or any BIP39 compatible wallet. 

<br>

**2\.** Locate the **12 or 24 words** you wrote down when first creating the wallet. 

<br>

**3\.** After re-installing and opening BlueWallet. Click on **Add a wallet**.

<br>

**4\.** Enter a name for your wallet in the first field. 

<br>

**5\.** Tap on **Import wallet** at the bottom of the screen.

<br>

**6\.** In the grey box, enter all 12 or 24 words **in the correct order** separated by spaces, then, tap **Import**.

<br>

**Be patient**, BlueWallet will attempt to recover your wallet. If successful it will redirect you to the homepage and a confirmation message will appear.
