## How do I send bitcoin?

Sending Bitcoin is very easy. 

&nbsp;

**1\.** From the main page tap on your newly created wallet. 

**2\.** On the bottom of the screen tap on **Send**.

**3\.** Enter the amount you wish to send. Tap the arrows to the right to change the currency (bitcoin, Sats or USD).

**4\.** In the **Address** field enter the address of the receiver. 

**5\.** In the **Note to self** field enter a reference for the payment - only you can see this. 

**6\.** Tap on **Fee** to set an appropriate fee - more details on fees [**here**](add link)

**7\.** Tap on **Next**, you'll be taken to a confirmation page. Review the amount and the address, you may tap **Details** in the top right corner for me information. 

**8\.** Tap **Send Now** to broadcast the transaction. 

&nbsp;

That's it! The transaction has been broadcast to the network and must be included in a block (confirmed/mined). The transaction will appear as *Pending* below **Transactions**. You'll notice it says **0 conf**. After 1 confirmation the bitcoin is confirmed and
is now owned by the recipient. It is typically recommended to wait for 6 confirmations before the transaction is considered entirely settled. 1 confirmation typically takes 10 minutes (on average).
