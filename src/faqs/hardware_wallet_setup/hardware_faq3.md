[Protecting your Seed Words](#protecting-your-seed-word)

Now that you've setup your Coldcard, it's time to add an extra layer of protection to your 24 seed words. Having them on paper is fine but that piece of paper
is susceptible to fire, water and other enviromental damage. Steel.... Steel is your answer and although it's not perfect it will help keep you words safe in the 
event that disaster strikes.

&nbsp;

By now you should have received your Seedplate from Coinkite. Let's transfer the 24 seed words you wrote now when creating your Coldcard wallet onto it. 

&nbsp;

**1\.** The seedplate is 2 sided and can accomodate 12 words per side.

**2\.** With the seedplate on a solid surface, the center punch in hand you'll add each of the 24 words.

**3\.** Each column 1, 2, 3 etc.. has enough room for the first 4 letters of each word, which is sufficient when attempting to restore a wallet. 
        Since most words are short, wallet software will auto complete the word when provided with the first 4 letters. 

**4\.** **Example:** If word number 1 is **certain**, in column **1** you'll use the center punch to make a mark next to the **C**, **E**, **R** and **T**, in that order.

**5\.** Repeat this process for all 24 words. Double check every single word and take your time. You can't undo it once it's in steel.

&nbsp;

Once finished it should look similar to this:

Congrats, you've backed up your 24 word seed into steel. Make sure to find a suitable location to store it. Remember you must also keep your Passphrase safe.
You might want to etch it into steel in a similar way or create other encrypted backups. Make sure you don't store the Passphrase with the Seedplate.
