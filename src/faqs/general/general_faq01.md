### What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin is a store of value. Bitcoin is an exit.

&nbsp;

Bitcoin is as a trust minimized, permissionless, censorship resistant, peer to peer digital monetary system. 
It's money for the digital age, controlled by no one, usable by everyone. It's an exit from the incumbent monetary system
which has grown old and tired.
