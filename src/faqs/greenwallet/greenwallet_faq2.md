## First Wallet Setup Guide

1. Open the Samourai application.
2. Leave network as `MAINNET` and press okay.
3. Tap **Get Started**.
4. Press `CHOOSE` and select a folder on your device. Any folder works, your encrypted wallet backup will be saved here.
5. We'll revisit the options on this page in another guide, for now press on `Create a new wallet`.
6. Create a strong **Passphrase**. This passphrase **IS** required along with your **12 words** (coming up) to access/restore you wallet. **Write it down and Keep it safe!**
7. Press `next` 
8. Enter a `PIN` code. This pin is used to unlock and access the Samourai app on your device. You should remember it if you can but it's **NOT** essential to recovering your wallet
9. Press `Finish`
10. Time to make a paper backup, this screen provides you with the option to download and print a handy paper backup sheet. If you have access to a printer this sheet is very practical. Otherwise, get a piece of paper and a pen ready and press the `blue arrow`.  
11. Using the paper backup sheet or another paper sheet, write down, write down.... once again, WRITE DOWN these 12 words. These words represent your bitcoin wallet and are **absolutely** necessary to restore and gain access to your bitcoin, alongside your **Passphrase**. If you lose these words or your passphrase **you cannot recover your bitcoin** - self-custody just got real. 
12. Before moving on, cross check that you've properly written down the words in the correct order. The words and the order in which they are presented is important
13. Tap `next` and you'll be presented with your **Passphrase**, make sure you wrote it down correctly.
14. Go ahead and press on `Claim your paynym`, although we won't use it immediately it'll be nice to have for the future. 

That's all, you've successfully created your first bitcoin wallet and are on your way to taking ownership of your bitcoin.
