### [What are transaction fees?](#what-are-transaction-fees)

The bitcoin network is secured by miners, who are compensated with transaction fees to include
transactions in blocks. Each bitcoin block has limited space (~4MB), creating a fee market based 
on transaction demand. As demand increases (more transactions), the fee required for timely inclusion in a block also rises. 
While fees are optional, they are highly recommended. In high-demand periods, transactions without fees may remain unconfirmed.

Most wallets calculate optimal fees based on transaction urgency. However, I recommend verifying the 
current fee rate using a <a href="https://mempool.space" class="underline text-blue-400 hover:text-[#3c6594]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">block explorer</a> for confirmation.

Fees are determined by the transaction size in kilobytes, not the transaction's bitcoin value. 
This distinction is crucial; accumulating many small Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) may result 
in higher fees than consolidating them into larger ones when fees are lower.
