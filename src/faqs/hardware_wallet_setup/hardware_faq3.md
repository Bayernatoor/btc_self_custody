### [Protecting your Seed Words & Backup Best Practices](#intermediate-seedwords-and-backups)

<h4 class="text-2xl pb-4 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">Backup up your Seed Words</h4>

Now that you've setup your Coldcard, it's important to backup your seed words in a safe, reliable and resilient way. Having them on paper is fine but that piece of paper
is susceptible to fire, water and other enviromental damage. Steel.... Steel is your answer and although it's not perfect it will help keep your seed words safe in the 
event that disaster strikes.

<br>

By now you should have received your Seedplate from Coinkite. Let's transfer the 24 seed words you wrote down during wallet creation onto it. 

<br>

<h4 class="text-2xl pb-4 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">Backing up in Steel</h4>

**1\.** The seedplate is 2 sided and can accomodate 12 words per side.

<br>
 
**2\.** With the seedplate on a solid surface, the center punch in hand you'll add each of the 24 words.

<br>
 
**3\.** Each column 1, 2, 3 etc.. has enough room for the first 4 letters of each word, which is sufficient when attempting to restore a wallet. 
        Since most words are short, wallet software will auto complete the word when provided with the first 4 letters. 

<br>
 
**4\.** **Example:** If word number 1 is **certain**, in column **1** you'll use the center punch to make a mark next to the **C**, **E**, **R** and **T**, in that order.

<br>
 
**5\.** Repeat this process for all 24 words. Double check every single word and take your time. You can't undo it once it's in steel.

<br>
 
<p class="text-md pb-2 font-semibold">Once finished it should appear similar to this:</p>

<h4 class="text-2xl pb-2 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">Backup Best Practices</h4>

Let's recap everything we've done so far in terms of backing up our sensitive wallet information. Make sure that you've done the following:

<br>

**1\.** Written down your 24 seed words on paper and created an encrypted backup of your Coldcard wallet onto a MicroSD card.  

<br>

**2\.** Written down your Passphrase on paper and created an encrypted backup of your Coldcard's Passphrase onto a separate MicroSD card. 

<br>

**3\.** Made a backup of your seed words into at least 1 steelplate. Using multiple steelplates allows you to store them in multiple locations for increased safety. It does however, increase the chances of someone finding one.

<br>

**4\.** Optionally, you made a backup of your Passphrase into a steelplate. Remember, the Passphrase is as important as the seed words.

<br>

**5\.** Do NOT store your 24 seed words with your Passphrase. You may store your Passphrase and the wallet's Extended(Master) Fingerprint together.

<br>

**6\.** Do NOT store any of this information online, no not take a digital photo of your seed words. The security/safety of this setup is dependent on keeping everything completely offline. 

<br>

Last but not least... remember to always KISS! **<a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keep It Simple Stupid</a>**.
