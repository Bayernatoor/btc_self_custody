<h4 class="text-2xl pb-4 text-[#f7931a] font-semibold">Sending Your First Transaction:</h4>

**1\.** From your wallet's main page, tap on **Send**.

**2\.** Either scan the QR code of the receiving wallet or paste the receiver's bitcoin address in the **Recipient Address** field.

</a>

<br>


**3\.** After scanning or pasting the address you will see:  
<ul class="list-decimal pl-8 pt-2 text-lg leading-loose text-white">
    <li> The <strong>Recipient Address</strong> field containing the recipient's bitcoin address.</li> 
    <li> This wallet's <strong>bitcoin balance</strong> and maximum amount that you can send. </li>
    <li> The ability to send your entire balance by tapping on <strong>Send all</strong>.</li>
    <li> Tapping on <strong>BTC</strong> lets you change the denomination, I prefer setting it to <italic>sats</italic>.</li>
    <li> At the bottom you can set your <strong>Network Fee</strong> or keep it as the default.</li>
</ul>

***A note on fees:*** *Bitcoin blocks have limited space which naturally creates a fee market. Fees will go up as demand for block space increases. Although
             wallets do a decent job in suggesting a feerate based on how quickly you need the transaction confirmed, I 
             recommend checking <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mempool Space<a> to determine
             an appropriate fee to set (Green wallet let's you set a custom fee). If you're in no rush, setting it low can help you save some sats.*


<br>

**5\.** Once you've set the amount and selected your fee, tap on **Next**. 

<br>

</a>

<br>

**6\.** Verify that everything looks good and then tap and slide to send at the bottom. 

<br>

</a>

<br>

**6\.** After sending you'll see the sent transaction appear on the main page. 

<br>

<a href="./../../../green_wallet_tx_sending.png" target="_blank">
    <img id="green wallet tx sending" src="./../../../green_wallet_tx_sending.png" alt="green wallet tx sending" width="400"/> 
</a>

<br>

**7\.** Tap on the transcation to view some details such as: number of confirmations, the time it was sent, the transaction id. You'll also have the ability to **Speed up Transaction** if you wish to do so by replacing with a higher fee. 

<br>

<a href="./../../../green_wallet_tx_details.png" target="_blank">
    <img id="green wallet tx details" src="./../../../green_wallet_tx_details.png" alt="green wallet tx details" width="400"/> 
</a>

<br>

That's it! The transaction has been broadcasted to the network and must now be included in a block (confirmed/mined). 
The transaction will appear as **Sending** below **Latest Transactions**. You'll notice it says **Unconfirmed**. After 1 confirmation the bitcoin is confirmed and
is now owned by the recipient. It is typically recommended to wait for 6 confirmations before the transaction is considered entirely settled. 
1 confirmation typically takes 10 minutes (on average).
