***A note on fees:*** *Bitcoin blocks have limited space which naturally creates a fee market. Fees will go up as demand for block space increases. Although
             wallets do a decent job in suggesting a feerate based on how quickly you need the transaction confirmed, I 
             recommend checking <a class="text-[#8cb4ff] underline-offset-auto font-semibold" href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mempool Space<a> to determine
             an appropriate fee to set. If you're in no rush, setting it low can help you save some sats.*


<br>

That's it! The transaction has been broadcasted to the network and must now be included in a block (confirmed/mined). 
The transaction will appear as ***Pending*** below ***Transactions***. You'll notice it says **0 conf**. After 1 confirmation the bitcoin is confirmed and
is now owned by the recipient. It is typically recommended to wait for 6 confirmations before the transaction is considered entirely settled. 
1 confirmation typically takes 10 minutes (on average).
