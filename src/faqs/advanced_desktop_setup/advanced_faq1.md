[Getting Up To Speed](#advance-setup)

**Note for all users: Since we're now in the advanced stage of self-custody, if at all possible, I recommend using a dedicated computer. Some computer whose only
job is to run bitcoin software. So, although you may already have Sparrow Wallet you might want to consider updating your setup before proceeding.**


<br>

If you've followed the basic and intermediate guides so far, and you're happy with your setup, go ahead and skip to part #2 - **Mutli-Signature Wallet Setup**.
Otherwise, if you're new here, have yet to take self-custody of your bitcoin and intend to follow this advanced guide then we'll need to get a few things setup before.

<br>

**1\.** Follow the **[Basic guide](http://localhost:3000/guides/basic/desktop/sparrow)** to setup Sparrow Wallet. Download the latest
version of Sparrow Wallet and follow the first 2 items "Quick word.." and "Verifying the downloaded binary..".

<br>

**2\.** Next, follow part 2 of the **[Intermediate guide](http://localhost:3000/guides/intermediate/node)** to select and setup a node implementation. 

<br>

Once you've completed these 2 tasks come back to this page.
